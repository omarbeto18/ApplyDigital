1. Framework Selection
I selected playwright because installation is easier and it has huge support of communities

2. Test Case Design
Within the E2E folder, there is a file named TestDesign

3. Automation Test Script Development
Inside the project you will see the main E2E project folder that contains the script, the implemented POM test script is in the file test-2.spec.ts
To execute the project you will need playwright installed and just open the project, once opened just execute the script from the Test module

5. Execution
There is a current video file of the executed script, you can find it on the test-results folder

6. Analysis and Test Report
The test execution report implemented with mochawesome is within the folder mochawesome-report
